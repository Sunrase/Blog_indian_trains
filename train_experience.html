      <h2>An exotic trip</h2>

      <div class="texte"></div>
      <p>During last summer holidays, I went to india to do an amazing sport, which is mountaineering. To achieve this, we needed to go in the himalayas. So we rode the Kalka Shatabdi Express and the Himalayan Queen from New Delhi to Shimla, which wasn't very fun at first. In fact, the New Delhi railway station was heavily overcrowded. I also saw poeple hopping on the train even before it halt at the station. As it is a lot hazardous, I was extremely scared for them. Tha atmosphere in the station was as if no one had one second to loose Then, while we were waiting for the train to enter the station, an announcement said that we needed to move to an another platform. It was relatively tough because we had to race through the crowd, but whatever we had to do, we had to get in time and not miss our train, the weather was the perfect one to do mountaineering and I would have been really sad if we couldn't get in this train. When the train finally entered into it, he seemed to me very regular but also very colorful and highly loud. A few hour after travelling, I halted at a rundown station in which a man was preparing some food for travellers, it was like a fast food but on a platform. This was certainely the strangest experience I have ever had during my journey and what I ate was surprisingly tasty, i felt full, thanks to this pantry-car boy. I also remember that at certain moments, we were able to see some poeple walking up and dow the railway tracks, why ? I don’t know but I found that extremely mysterious. Finally, we arrived at Shimla, i was completely tongue-tied when i hop offed the train, there were absolutely gorgeous landscapes which we were allowed to gaze at. In conclusion to my journey, I really liked to experience haow travelling in indian train looks like. Espescially from New-Delhi, a modern Indian city, to this authentic cultural indian city. If one day, you can go there, I’d like to say that you can go with your eyes closed, but still open them a little to admire these beautiful landscapes. I was incredibly impressed by the changing of atmosphere.</p>
