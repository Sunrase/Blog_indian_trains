      <h2>Indian cities</h2>

      <div class="texte"></div>
      <p>During my trip in India, i visited a lot of indian cities some of these have common points but they all have a contrast. </p>

      <p>Firstly, i visited New Delhi which is the capital city of india. It is a historical and cultural center of the country with its 16 main monuments such as the India Gate, the Delhi Parliament or the Agrasen Ki Baoli, an ancient dry well that can be visited for free. I also found that this city was the one in which the temperature was the highest, indeed, she has a high density of population and pollution is very present because of the numerous activities that it concentrates.</p>
        
      <p> Secondly, i went to Shimla. One of its specificities is the arrangement of the buildings on the hill. it is a very touristy city which has many historical monuments. it is also easy to access from the capital via its 2 stations and 2 major roads. This city, like Darjeeling, provides a resplendent landscape. it is close to natural places such as waterfalls and numerous viewpoints. One problem I noticed however is that some homes are destroyed due to the collapse of the hill.</p>
        
      <p> Then, i traveled to Siliguri. This city is the beginning of the famous Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. She presents it has a lot of streets so it is really easy to get lost. I also observed that there are many small businesses like restaurants as the "Backyard Bistro Hakimpara". It is located in a modern building which also contrasts with the rest of the city with its traditional dwellings. Besides this fact, I found the dishes delicious and well presented, I recommend it.</p>
        
      <p> Finally, i will describe my favorite city that i visited, Darjeeling. It is an observation point of the Tiger Hill, an absolutely fabulous mountain and where we are able to see the mount everest on a clear day. It is a high altitude city which rises to 2045 meters above sea level, one of the highest cities I have ever visited. The buildings are very beautiful and have an old and traditional charm like the Buddhist Temple. The only negative point of this city is that the entire hill is urbanized. You can see the city in the background.</p>
