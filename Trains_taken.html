      <h2>Special trains</h2>

      <div class="texte"></div>
      <p>In India, nearly 8 million of poeple ride the train everyday. So over all time i passed in this country, i had to ride one and i started with the Kalka Shatabdi Express and the Himalayan Queen. i'll not talking about them in this section, if you want to know what it is to travel on these trains, go to the train experience section, the unique things i can tell there is that i really found the travel exciting even if it is one of the longest train line that i have taken with more than 9 hours. As i arrived at New Delhi airport "Indria Gandhi" i had to take some commuter trains to move between the differents stations. These trains are often overcrowded and it is hard to get on. If i had to resume this experience in one word it would have been "unbearable". Now, let's move on an another train, a special train. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is a historical legacy from the English colonization. It is a steam train that connects Siliguri and Darjeeling. Its most suprising feature is certainly its 2 feet track, it is extremely narrow and this gave him the nickname of "Toy train". The total size of the railway track is 82 kilometers that can be covered in 7 hours with an average speed of 16 kilometers per hour. Yes it is long and we can go faster with a car but with this train, you can take your time to gaze at nature, you can make new friends or get acquainted with other poeple. Personnaly, i was looking for animals but i have never seen the color of it, i was very disappointed. the noise of the train certainly scared them away. You can observe The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in the background and on the left side.
