      <h2>Special trains</h2>

      <div class="texte"></div>
      <p>In India, nearly 8 million of people ride the train everyday. So over all time I passed in this country, I had to ride one and I started with the Kalka Shatabdi Express and the Himalayan Queen. I won't talk about them in this section, if you want to know what it is to travel on these trains, go to the train experience section, the unique things I can tell there is that I really found the travel exciting even if it is one of the longest train line that I have taken with more than 9 hours. As I arrived at New Delhi airport "Indria Gandhi" I had to take some commuter trains to move between the differents stations. These trains are often overcrowded and it is hard to get on. If I had to resume this experience in one word it would have been "unbearable". Now, let's move on to another train, a special train. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is a historical legacy from the English colonization. It is a steam train that connects Siliguri and Darjeeling. Its most suprising feature is certainly its 2 feet track, it is extremely narrow what gave it the nickname of "Toy train". The total size of the railway track is 82 kilometers that can be covered in 7 hours with an average speed of 16 kilometers per hour. Yes it is long and we can go faster with a car but with this train, you can take your time to gaze at nature, you can make new friends or get acquainted with other poeple. Personnaly, I was looking for animals but I have never seen the color of it, I was very disappointed. the noise of the train certainly scared them away. You can observe The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in the background and on the left side.
